# socialHash

a public posting platform created for the [2023 Chainlink Spring Hackathon](https://chain.link/hackathon)

## Concept

- A public RSS feed/posting platform that's self-governed and permanant
- A source of truth for users looking to get status updates from the owners of their products/services
- Hashing a topic/identifier leads users to relevant content for discoverability
- Data permanance protects content that is at risk on centralized platforms due to authoritarian governments, regulatory concern, or shareholder bias
